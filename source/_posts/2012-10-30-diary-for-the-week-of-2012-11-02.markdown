* Boss got a note from HR saying that my promotion was *official*.
  It's a 31.6% pay increase, can't wait to actually see it!

* Started bring the pluggable version of my Node.js LDAP server back
  to life.  This version only supports a single database connection
  but that will have to be changed.
  
  The tamu-ldap-mapper module also needs to be absorbed back into it.
  
  Started off by writing some
  [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin)
  features for it and testing them with
  [cucumber-js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js).  I totally
  love this stuff!
